<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Daily Routine</h2>
<div style="width:800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
<p>Everyday, I wake up at 6 AM in the mourning, get changed into my school clothes, and eat a waffle. I go to the bus and drive to school. At school, I take math class first. After, I take US history. For 2 periods, I sit on a comfy chair and work on a computer. Composition and Chemistry are the last 2. I don't have 7th period so I go home after that. At home, I do all the boring homework, play video games, and sleep. </p>
